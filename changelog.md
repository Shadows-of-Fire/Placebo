## 7.3.2
* Un roman: Updated Ukranaian translation.
* Excaliburns: Added a config option to control first-person trails.
  * This config option is client-only and defaults to false.
  * Previously, trails were always enabled in first-person, but now require changing the config to see in first person.

## 7.3.1
* Added SlotUpdateListener so I can stop copying `Runnable listener` into all my menu classes.

## 7.3.0
* Added an Ingredient codec.
* Made CachedObject use ConcurrentHashMap to avoid issues resolving offthread (induced by FastSuite recipe matching in parallel).
* Reduced conditions-not-met log message from PlaceboJsonReloadList

## 7.2.1
* Added a method to invalidate all cached objects of a given type.

## 7.2.0
* Updated TypeKeyed to no longer require setting the serializer. Objects should be aware of what their serializer is, as two serializers should not produce the same object.
  * Breaking change for Apotheosis, Gateways, and HNN, so all of those will need to be updated as well.
  * Also improved some validation in the deserialization process.
* Added more codec support across the board.

## 7.1.8

* StepFunction is now a final class.

## 7.1.0

  * It coerces read(FriendlyByteBuf), read(JsonObject), write(FriendlyByteBuf) and JsonObject write() from the source class as a serializer.

## 6.5.3
* Added WeightedJsonReloadListener to better handle weighted entries.

## 6.5.2
* Re-added the ItemUseEvent needed by Apotheosis.
  * Forge declined to add this event, so here it will stay.

## 6.5.1
* Made RandomAttributeModifier not crash on fail due to how it is used in Gateways.
  * Fixes GatewaysToEternity#3

## 6.5.0
* Rewrite to RecipeHelper to allow recipes to be regenerated on reload, rather than built once.
  * This means that configs that adjust recipes can work without restarting the game.
  * However, due to timing, it is likely they will need a double-reload to trigger.
* Added various utilities needed by Gateways to Eternity 2.0.0.
* Fixed a bug where Placebo-JSON reload listeners were syncing data back to the host on SSP/LAN
  * This caused data to be lost when only part of the object is sent to the client for any reason.

## 6.4.2

  * This should fix energy values going negative, I hope...

  * All impacted mods will have corresponding updates.
* Added new functionality to Configuration to support top-level comments, as well as a title.
  * A document detailing the file specification will also be linked to.
